- Below stats are OUTDATED !!! ! !! 
- Slowest functions are: ^^^^^^^^^M
    - Block Sum (40%) (flat matrix will prob, make this WAY faster, should be able to parallelisze/? this as well)
    - kTensor Direct Sum (9%)
    - kTensor Generate (7%)

- HopfAlgebra parser
- Refactor cokernel's solve commutative diagram
- Refactor more code into smaller compartments
- Github Copilot for comments everywhere ?
