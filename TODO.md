- Slow functions are:
    - kTensor Direct Sum (9%) 
    - kTensor Generate (12%)
    - kTensor add_and_restrict (12%)
    - GradedLinear block sum (16%) # probably is the fasted it can go ?
    
- HopfAlgebra parser
- Refactor cokernel's solve commutative diagram
- Refactor more code into smaller compartments
- Github Copilot for comments everywhere ?
